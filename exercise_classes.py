"""
In this exercise we will create a number of classes and apply some elementary
object-oriented programming.
Implement the following classes describing some of the actors in an elementary
video game.
All actors have a property "strength". Strength is a number that can be
increased by x by calling the method "increase_strength(x)", resp. "strength" is
decreased by x by calling the method "decrease_strength(x)". If the strength drops
below zero, it should remain zero.
The property "is_alive" should start out True, and become False once strength
reaches zero. Contrary to popular opinion, Zombies and Vampires should
start out as alive.
All actors will contain the method "fight()". Actor x can start a fight with
Actor y by calling "x.fight(y)". The one with the highest strength wins,
the other dies. The winner is damaged however, and gets its strength decreased
by the strength of the opponent. If the strengths are equal, both die horribly.
All actors have a "kills" property which increases by one when the actor wins a
fight.
Class Hero has an special property "magic". Hero's "strength" can increase only
if "magic" is above zero. x increase in "strength" causes x decrease in "magic".
Class Vampire will increase its property "strength" after winning a fight, instead
of decreasing it, by half the strength of its enemy.
Class Zombie will increase its "strength" by x at the beginning of every fight
_it starts itself_, where x is a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.
