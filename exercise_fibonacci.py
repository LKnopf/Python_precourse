"""
In this excercise we will learn the general usage of functions and flow control
in a python script. We ask you to implement a function to calculate the first
n numbers of the Fibonacci series.
The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of
the two preceding numbers, given that the first two Fibonacci numbers are both
1. The first 6 numbers of the Fibonacci series are therefore: 1,1,2,3,5,8
You should design a program that calculates the first n numbers of the
Fibonacci series (having as the two starting numbers: 1,1) and saves them in
a list that at the end of the program will be printed.
"""


"""
Put your code in this section of the script:
"""


def generate_fibonacci(n):

    fib = [0] * n 
    
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
        
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
        
    if n == 2:
        return [1,1]
        
    if n >= 3:
        fib = [0] * n
        fib[0] = 1
        fib[1] = 1
        
        for step in range(2,n):
            print step
            fib[step] = fib[step-1] + fib[step-2]
        
    
    return fib
